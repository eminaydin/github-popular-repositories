## General Info

Website to display and star popular repositories of the week. In this project I have decided to play with Github API and take it to another level. Main story is, user can scroll through popular repositories and filter them by specific programming language from the select field in navigation bar. If user wants to star the repository, the star button on top of each repository card will take the action and send the respective repository to local storage. All of the starred repositories will be available in another tab even after user leaves the website and comes back since data is stored in the local storage.

I am particularly happy with this project from the design and functionality wise. It took me not longer than couple of hours to finish
the sceleton of the website, where for the rest of the time I was playing with design and additional features. Feel free to check out the demo!
